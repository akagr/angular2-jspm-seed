# Angular 2 production seed with jspm

To get going fast, clone the repo, do an `npm install` followed by `jspm install`.

Start the app with `npm start`.

Build a minified jspm bundle with `npm run build`.

## Known Issues
JSPM `0.16.24` seems to throw errors when building the app. If that happens, rollback with `npm install jspm@0.16.19` which at this time is working well.

## To Do

* Better gulp tooling
* Tests
* Improved example app
